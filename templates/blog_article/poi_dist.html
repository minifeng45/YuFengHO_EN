                        <p>For the first time, I got interests in Poisson process based on a distribution “magnifique”: Poisson distribution. I was fascinated because of the process can fit in wide range of real life events, e.g. operation of consumer services, time of bus arrival, and the chance of a knight falling down from horseback. Today, I will introduce an interesting case happening in my real life: Four ducks vs. Anti-bird net.</p>

To achieve that, the field needs to be surrounded by anti-bird net, so that the ducks would not escape from the field. However, due to the limit budget and workforce, farmers took a risk of duck escaping to just utilise the minimal materials for the surrounding, and see the efficiency of this system.</blockquote>

                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
                        <p>At first, it is important to understand the expectation of duck escaping. For this data, I asked for the expectation from the farmers. “Combien de temps pense-toi qu’un canard trouvera un moyen de sortir? (English: How long do you think a duck will find a way out?)” I asked. Based on the rough estimate with a lot of emotional bias, they gave me a number: 10 hours for one duck. Secondly, I added up other data from the fact I knew, 4 ducks in this trial, and 16 hours in field per day (after that the farmers would push them into small chamber for sleeping). Finally, I get the required data for our evaluation.</p>
                        <p>After collecting the data, I need to define the question. It is explicit of estimating the expected time that all ducks escape from the anti-bird net, so that we can know after how long we will lose all of our ducks. Then, they work for a unit of three days, so they demand the situation while they check the number of ducks once in three days. Below is the precondition for this exciting calculation!</p>

                        <p>Thus, before we start the calculation, let me introduce Poisson distribution briefly.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction of Poisson distribution</h2>
                        <p>Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution, published by a French mathematician, Denis Poisson. It expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. The prerequisite is each event is independent and occurs with a known constant mean rate. The probability mass function (pmf) is expressed below:</p>

                        <!-- list with dots -->
                        <li>k is the number of occurrences (k=0,1,2…)</li>
                        <li>e is Euler's number</li>
                        <li>! is the factorial function.</li>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Calculation</h2>
                        <h4> Expected time that all ducks have founded the way out </h4>
                        <p>Firstly, the total ducks are four, and we (the farmers and I) interest in the time that the last duck is gone. Therefore, I randomly generate the hours that each duck has its possible time point of departure, and they follow poi(λ=10) with n =4. Then the return would be like T = (13,11,9,5). Subsequently, I select the maximal value as the result. At this point, one simulation has been done.</p>
                        <p>Following by that, I run hundreds of thousands of simulation to get the stable mean and variance. Here is some code from R below:</p>
                        <!-- can write code in this part -->

     all_duck_gone = max(duck_escape)

                            <h4>After 3-day work, how many ducks are expected still working for the farmers?</h4>
                            <p>In this question, it is necessary to look back to the pmf and slightly modify the equation. Instead of the average number of events λ, I rewrite it as the number of events r happened in a given time and the time length we would like to assign. Then the formula is like:</p>
                            <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='dist/assets/img/poi_dist/6.gif') }}" alt="..." /></a>
                            <p>Afterwards, I start calculate the expected events that happened in our given time t. In this case, r is the reciprocal of λ, r = 1/λ = 1/10, and t is 3-day work, 3*16 = 48. However, the time points of departure for all ducks are independent, and for a duck, there are only 2 situation: departure (X = 1) or not departure (X=0). Following this train of thought, I calculate the expectation of departure for a duck. It means the possibility that it is still inside the net after 48 hours. Finally, adding up the expectation of four ducks, we would know the expected ducks are still inside the net and working for us.</p>
                            <p>The code below illustrates the process.</p>
                        <tbody>
                            <tr>
                                <td >

                    <blockquote>C'est bon! je voudrais cocher si les canards travaillent bien!</blockquote>
                    <p>After a hard-working brainstorming, I could not wait to tell the result to them, but before that, I went out to check the ducks if they were still in the farm. Here was the real situation in the field.</p>

                    <blockquote>Merde! Il n'y a pas de canard dans le champ!</blockquote>
                    <p>I yelled, ran, pushed aside the grass in order to find them. Finally, I found them in the back of the chamber, and herded them into the chamber.</p>
                    <blockquote>"Bof! It is scaring! I was literally at the margin of being fired. They disappeared only 8 hours for the first time. C'est bizarre…" I thought</blockquote>
                    <p>To investigate on what happened. I start looking after them for couple of days after the event happened, and I found out something…</p>
                    <h4>Mathematical simulation vs. Real life</h4>
                    <p>As a matter of that, ducks are social animal. They stay in group! Therefore if there is one duck find the way out, it would want to get back, or it would attract other three to leave with it! There is not possible for a duck outside but other three inside the net…</p>
